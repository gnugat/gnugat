💙 I love my craft, learning, and automating boring tasks.

🛠️ So my pet projects usually revolve around code that writes (and evolves) code:

* 👓 [spec-gen](https://github.com/memio/spec-gen) _phpspec extension that improves its code generator_
* 📝 [Redaktilo](https://github.com/gnugat/redaktilo) _Text editor library_
* ⌨️ [Memio](https://github.com/memio/memio) _PHP code generator library_

🐜 But I like minimal stuff too:

* 🎶 [Symfony Empty Edition](https://github.com/gnugat/symfony-empty-edition): _replaces standard edition with bare minimum skeleton_
* 🪵 [Symfony Micro Framework Bundle](https://github.com/gnugat/micro-framework-bundle) _replaces FrameworkBundle with bare minimum_
